# Peerlist Profile Kanban Board ðŸ’š

This [Drag and drop board](https://dnd-theta.vercel.app/) has been made using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), React Beautiful DND, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [React-table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) and [React Toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify#readme). 


## Features:


- ### Drag and Drop applicants
  The major purpose of the drag and drop board is to drag applicants to different stages of their job application. Three statuses that I mentioned are<br/>
  - REJECTED
  - APPLIED
  - SHORTLISTED

- ### Search 
  It allows you to search within these drag and drop lists, it updates on realtime when you search.

- ### State Persistence
  I have used redux-persist to persist the state of the board so that even refresh does not hamper the state of your lists!!!

- ## You can Reject Me
  I would ask you to reject me on the board, there is a sweet and simple message for you, I hope you enjoy the Pun ðŸ’š
